This is an interactive GUI Pokedex that uses all my actuals knowlegde about python (31/05/2018)

You need to have installed BeautifulSoup4

All you need to get it worked is to download all files except downloadinfo.

Downloadinfo is for downloading from internet the necessary resources to get it worked.

To run up the program run __init.py__ file

__NOTE__: You need an internet connection to automatically download files. 

Last time tried downdloading files: 31/05/2018
