This is an interactive GUI Pokedex that uses all my actuals knowlegde about python (31/05/2018)

You need to have installed BeautifulSoup4

All you need to get it worked is to download the next files:
  - __init.py__
  - __DownloadInfo.py__
  - __Pokedex.py__
  - __Pokemon.py__

The folders Pokemoninfo and Pokemonpictures are not necessary. You can download them if you dont want to wait.

To run up the program run __init.py__ file, everything needed is going to be downloaded.

__NOTE__: You need an internet connection to automatically download files, everything downloads. Last time tried: 31/05/2018
